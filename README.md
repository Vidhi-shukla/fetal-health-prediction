# fetal-health-prediction
This project uses machine learning to predict fetal health based on Cardiotocography (CTG) data. Models like Logistic Regression, SVC, KNN, LightGBM, CNN, and RNN classify fetal conditions as Normal, Suspect, or Pathological, aiding healthcare providers in accurate prenatal care and early complication detection.
